# AwesomeWM
That's just my awesomewm config, yeah im trying to make a clone of the i3wm features + UI in awesomewm. Why? I have no idea...

## Install
Check if there is a folder called `awesome` in your `$XDG_CONFIG` directory, if so... delete it.
```
- git clone https://github.com/tosuki/awesome-i3 $HOME/.config/awesome
```
